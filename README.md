Interview Prep was started in 2025 by Venkata Ramprasad Pade to help you excel in interviews. This website equips you with resources to prepare for interviews, including frequently asked questions and their solutions. It also offers a personal blog feature, allowing you to log questions immediately after an interview. By revisiting these questions, you can identify patterns, commit solutions to muscle memory, and make your upcoming interviews significantly easier.
